#0 Install Python and VS Code from Microsoft Store
	- Start VS Code and install extensions for Python and Jupyter (ctrl+shift+x)

#1 Create project directory for project files and virtual environment (venv)
	- Do not use spaces in naming but rather "_" for example
	- Do not change names in path of directory later, so choose good names long-term

#2 Inside project directory: shift+rclick and start PowerShell in directory

#3 Create new venv in PowerShell: python -m venv {name of venv}

#4 Activate venv in PowerShell: . .\{name of venv}\Scripts\activate.ps1
	- If active, next line in PowerShell starts with ({name of venv})
	- If execution is disabled by System run in admin mode: powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
	- To reactivate policy run afterwards: powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted 

#5 Install necessary packages with pip in PowerShell: python -m pip install {name of package}
	- Install package "ipykernel" for Jupyter to work inside VS Code
	- Packages will only exist in venv
	- For installation of specific version: python -m pip install {name of package}=={0.0.0} (to check availabale versions: pip index versions {name of package} 

#6 Open VS Code and open project folder in the VS Code explorer (ctrl+shift+e)

#7 In the folder, create new jupyter notebook file {file name}.ipynb and open it
	- Select your venv as Python kernel for this notebook (button on the top right)

#8 For future package installations in your venv, open terminal inside VS Code
	- Make sure to select the PowerShell (if cmd is active, type ">Terminal: Select Default Profile" in searchbar)
	- Activate your venv in the terminal as in #4
	- Install packages as in #5

(#9) Save and install favorite packages with PowerShell inside active venv: pip freeze > packages.txt
	- Copy txt inside other venv to install packages: python -m pip install -r packages.txt
